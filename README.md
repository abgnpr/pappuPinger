# pappuPinger
A node script that pings our university website and notifies us about changes.

* Clone the repository
* Fire up your terminal
* Move to the cloned repo folder

  ```bash
  npm install
  node pinger.js
  ```

* You’ll find the rest self explanatory. Trust me.



**NOTE** : Ours is a cool University, called PPU (Patliputra University), situated at the heart of Bihar. Very affectionately, we like to call it “Pappu University” and hence the project name.
