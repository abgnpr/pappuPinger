# pappuPinger
A node script that pings our university website and notifies us about changes.

* Clone the repository

* Fire up your terminal

* Move to the cloned folder

  ```bash
  npm install
  node pinger.js
  ```

* You’ll find the rest self explanatory. Trust me.

* NOTE: You must have nodejs v12 or above

**Bonus for Termux Users:** You get a system notification if you have `termux-api` installed. 

**Extending the script:** You may use the script with any of the websites to monitor text changes. Just change the `url`.

NOTE: Ours is a cool University, called PPU (Patliputra University), situated at the heart of Bihar. Very affectionately, we like to call it “Pappu University” and hence the project name.
